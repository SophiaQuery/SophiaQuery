##  About Me

Hey! I'm **Sophia Black** Also known as **Sophia Query** a developer, media enthusiast, and passionate advocate for **game and online service compliance**. With a background in **software development** and a love for **media creation**, I thrive on building innovative solutions while helping others. I spend my time diving into code, capturing moments through a lens, and working on projects that improve the online community.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me behind the camera, working on my next **cinematography** or **videography** project, or giving back to those who need it most. My largest passion is working to support and assist those less fortunate than myself, whether it’s through **gaming** or **real-world efforts**.

##  Main Passion Project

### FiveM Database

One of my main projects is a **FiveM Database**.  
It's a platform that helps players on **FiveM** better understand **compliance** within the FiveM platform, offering resources on what is compliant and what isn't. This is aimed at ensuring creators avoid issues and stay safe from any bad actors who could jeopardize their creations.
